## Biography
Hello there. My name is Philip Fan Yang (b. 1999, Phil to friends!). I am a PhD student in Dr. Andrew Davies' lab ([see MarEcoTec profile](https://marecotec.com/team_member/philip-yang/)) and have been at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography since Fall 2022. 
My research interests span marine ecology, oceanography, and geospatial science. 
Most of my dissertation work takes place in the northern Gulf of Mexico studying mesophotic coral and coralline algal reefs that occur from 30 m to 150 m deep. 
Of course, I did not just plop down where I am today, it is the culmination of 24 years of life and story. Below, I share some information about me.

I like to play basketball and have been doing so since I was eight or nine years old. 
Here is a link to a short clip of my unremarkable high school basketball years: [Youtube evidence of Phil's (#10) basketball glory days...](https://youtu.be/c5X_J0UJ9ZA?si=0rrcNtH9F42qPF2U&t=2040)

### StoryMaps
I have made a couple of ESRI StoryMaps. 
1. The first is a presentation of my senior thesis work at Villanova University in the WETFEET Lab led by Dr. Samantha Chapman and Dr. Adam Langley.[Boat wakes in Florida](https://villanova.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=090d7618677e433faf9fda3b6a18923e) 
2. The second is a StoryMap in a bio format that I originally made to send to professors that I reached out to for graduate opportunities.[Life in one scroll](https://arcg.is/040mvD)
3. The third is a StoryMap that I made as a public outreach piece and journal of sorts to display my Fulbright research experience in the Philippines in 2022.[(Philip)pines: a Fulbright research experience](https://arcg.is/005DDH)
